1) What are the necessary preprocessing steps regarding:

a) classes ?
We check if there are balanced classes. Then we can see correlations between classes and features. Finally, we have to separate them from the features. 

b) categorical features ? 
Fisrt we identify these in order to separate them from the continuous features, then we extract multicategorical features (i.e., features with more than 2 categories) and we use a dummy encoder on these. 

c) continuous features ?
We have to separate them from the categorical features, then we standardize them after spliting our data. We have to standardise only the train and test features.    



2) Confusion matrix:

a)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed with a Heart disease (false positives) ?
5

b)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?
11



3) Changing the threshold:

a)What is the precision if we change the threshold to have a 0.95 recall ? 
0.47

b) How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?
2



4) Choosing an overall metric:

a) If I can compute my test sample probabilities and care more about the positive class, which overall metric should I use to compare classifiers ? 
average precision score

b) And if I only have the class predictions and no probabilities ?
